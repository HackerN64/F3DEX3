# F3DEX3

Modern microcode for N64 romhacks. Will make you want to finally ditch HLE.
Heavily modified version of F3DEX2, partially rewritten from scratch.

**F3DEX3 is in alpha. It is not guaranteed to be bug-free, and updates may bring
breaking changes.**

[View the documentation here](https://hackern64.github.io/F3DEX3/) (or just look
through the docs folder).

## Features

Compared to F3DEX2 or any other F3D family microcode, F3DEX3 is...
- faster on the RDP
- in `LVP_NOC` configuration (see docs), also faster on the RSP
- more accurate
- full of new visual features
- measurable in performance

all at the same time!

### New visual features

- New geometry mode bit `G_PACKED_NORMALS` enables **simultaneous vertex colors
  and normals/lighting on the same mesh**, by encoding the normals in the unused
  2 bytes of each vertex using a variant of [octahedral encoding](https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2014/04/16/octahedron-normal-vector-encoding/).
  The normals are effectively as precise as with the vanilla method of replacing
  vertex RGB with normal XYZ.
- New geometry mode bit `G_AMBOCCLUSION` enables **ambient occlusion** for
  opaque materials. Paint the shadow map into the vertex alpha channel; separate
  factors (set with `SPAmbOcclusion`) control how much this affects the ambient
  light, all directional lights, and all point lights.
- New geometry mode bit `G_LIGHTTOALPHA` moves light intensity (maximum of R, G,
  and B of what would normally be the shade color after lighting) to shade
  alpha. Then, if `G_PACKED_NORMALS` is also enabled, the shade RGB is set to
  the vertex RGB. Together with alpha compare and some special display lists
  from fast64 which draw triangles two or more times with different CC settings,
  this enables **cel shading**. Besides cel shading, `G_LIGHTTOALPHA` can also
  be used for [bump mapping](https://renderu.com/en/spookyiluhablog/post/23631)
  or other unusual CC effects (e.g. texture minus vertex color times lighting).
- New geometry mode bits `G_FRESNEL_COLOR` or `G_FRESNEL_ALPHA` enable
  **Fresnel**. The dot product between a vertex normal and the vector from the
  vertex to the camera is computed; this is then scaled and offset with settable
  factors. The resulting value is then stored to shade color or shade alpha.
  This is useful for:
    - making surfaces like water and glass fade between transparent when viewed
      straight-on and opaque when viewed at a large angle
    - applying a fake "outline" around the border of meshes
    - the N64 bump mapping implementation mentioned above
- New geometry mode bit `G_LIGHTING_SPECULAR` changes lighting computation from
  diffuse to **specular**. If enabled, the vertex normal for lighting is
  replaced with the reflection of the vertex-to-camera vector over the vertex
  normal. Also, a new size value for each light controls how large the light
  reflection appears to be. This technique is lower fidelity in some ways than
  the vanilla `hilite` system, as it is per-vertex rather than per-pixel, but it
  allows the material to be textured normally. Plus, it supports all scene
  lights (including point) with different dynamic colors, whereas the vanilla
  system supports up to two directional lights and more than one dynamic color
  is difficult.
- New geometry mode bits `G_ATTROFFSET_ST_ENABLE` and `G_ATTROFFSET_Z_ENABLE`
  apply settable offsets to vertex ST (`SPAttrOffsetST`) and/or Z
  (`SPAttrOffsetZ`) values. These offsets are applied after their respective
  scales. For Z, this enables a method of drawing coplanar surfaces like decals
  but **without the Z fighting** which can happen with the RDP's native decal
  mode. For ST, this enables **UV scrolling** without CPU intervention.

### Performance improvements

- **56 verts** can fit into DMEM at once, up from 32 verts in F3DEX2, and only
  13% below the 64 verts of reject microcodes. This reduces DRAM traffic and
  RSP time as fewer verts have to be reloaded and re-transformed, and also makes
  display lists shorter.
- New **occlusion plane** system allows the placement of a 3D quadrilateral
  where objects behind this plane in screen space are culled. This can
  dramatically improve RDP performance by reducing overdraw in scenes with walls
  in the middle, such as a city or an indoor scene.
- If a material display list being drawn is the same as the last material, the
  texture loads in the material are skipped (the second time). This effectively
  results in **auto-batched rendering** of repeated objects, as long as each
  only uses one material. This system supports multitexture and all types of
  loads. If this system incorrectly culls supposedly repeated texture loads
  which actually differ due to segment manipulation, you can locally disable it
  using the new `SPDontSkipTexLoadsAcross` command.
- New `SPTriangleStrip` and `SPTriangleFan` commands **pack up to 5 tris** into
  one 64-bit GBI command (up from 2 tris in F3DEX2). In any given object, most
  tris can be drawn with these commands, with only a few at the end drawn with
  `SP2Triangles` or `SP1Triangle`. So, this cuts the triangle portion of display
  lists roughly in half, saving DRAM traffic and ROM space.
- New `SPAlphaCompareCull` command enables culling of triangles whose computed
  shade alpha values are all below or above a settable threshold. This
  **substantially reduces the performance penalty of cel shading**--only tris
  which "straddle" the cel threshold are drawn twice, the others are only drawn
  once.
- A new "hints" system encodes the expected size of the target display list into
  call, branch, and return DL commands. This allows only the needed number of DL
  commands in the next DL to be fetched, rather than always fetching full
  buffers, **saving some DRAM traffic** (maybe around 100 us per frame). The
  bits used for this are ignored by HLE.
- Segment addresses are now resolved relative to other segments (feature by
  Tharo). This enables a strategy for **skipping repeated material DLs**: call
  a segment to run the material, remap the segment in the material to a
  display list that immediately returns, and so if the material is called again
  it won't run.
- New `SPMemset` command fills a specified RDRAM region with a repeated 16-bit
  value. This can be used for clearing the Z buffer or filling the framebuffer
  or the letterbox with a solid color **faster than the RDP can in fill mode**.
  Practical performance may vary due to scheduling constraints.

### Miscellaneous

- **Point lighting** has been redesigned. The appearance when a light is close
  to an object has been improved. Fixed a bug in F3DEX2/ZEX point lighting where
  a Z component was accidentally doubled in the point lighting calculations. The
  quadratic point light attenuation factor is now an E3M5 floating-point number.
  The performance penalty for using large numbers of point lights has been
  reduced.
- Maximum number of directional / point **lights raised from 7 to 9**. Minimum
  number of directional / point lights lowered from 1 to 0 (F3DEX2 required at
  least one). Also supports loading all lights in one DMA transfer
  (`SPSetLights`), rather than one per light.
- New `SPLightToRDP` family of commands (e.g. `SPLightToPrimColor`) writes a
  selectable RDP command (e.g. `DPSetPrimColor`) with the RGB color of a
  selectable light (any including ambient). The alpha channel and any other
  parameters are encoded in the command. With some limitations, this allows the
  tint colors of cel shading to **match scene lighting** with no code
  intervention. Also useful for other lighting-dependent effects.

### Profiling

F3DEX3 introduces a suite of performance profiling capabilities. These take the
form of performance counters, which report cycle counts for various operations
or the number of items processed of a given type. There are a total of 21
performance counters across multiple microcode versions. See the Profiling
section below.
