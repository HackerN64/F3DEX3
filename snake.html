F3DEX3 triangle snake demo</div></div>
    <p><em>A triangle snake, drawn with a single F3DEX3 <code>gsSPTriSnake</code> command (and multiple <code>gsSPContinueSnake</code>s). Flat shading is used to emphasize that each consecutive triangle in the snake has its Vertex 1 be a new index, not the same as one of the indices of the previous triangle. Drawing this with a single snake uses 3.7x less memory bandwidth for triangle display list commands compared to drawing the same mesh with <code>gsSP2Triangles</code> commands like in F3DEX2.</em></p>
<p><b>Triangle Snake</b> is F3DEX3's new accelerated triangles command. It is capable of drawing any shape which is expressible as a single, non-branching chain of connected triangles. At each triangle, the command encodes whether the snake turns left or right&ndash;in other words, whether this triangle is attached to one or the other of the yet-unconnected edges of the previous triangle. A traditional triangle strip is a special case of a triangle snake with alternating directions (left-right-left-right-etc.), and similarly a traditional triangle fan is a triangle snake with the same direction repeatedly (left-left-left-etc.).</p>

<p>A snake can be arbitrarily long. It starts with a <code>SPTriSnake</code> command, which may be followed by one or more <code>SPContinueSnake</code> macros which encode continued indices. The latter are not commands (there's no command byte)&ndash;they are just more index data sequentially in the display list. In other words, the display list input buffer is the storage for the indices data. The microcode correctly handles the case when the snake runs off the end of the input buffer and the input buffer needs to be refilled. The refilled data starts from the start of the input buffer, as if it were regular commands; this matters for the hints system.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md50"></a>
Memory Bandwidth</h2>
<p>The goal of any accelerated triangles system in a microcode is to reduce the memory bandwidth used for loading triangle indices. The actual tris drawn are the same regardless of how their indices are encoded in the display list, so we do not consider the performance of actually drawing the tris, only loading their indices.</p>
<p>An <code>SPTriSnake</code> command by itself contains 7 vertices and draws 5 triangles (because the first triangle needs two extra vertices to start itself). An <code>SPContinueSnake</code> macro contains 8 vertices and draws 8 tris, in each case continuing the existing snake. The F3D family microcodes before F3DEX3 only provided <code>SP1Triangle</code> and <code>SP2Triangle</code> commands, so any snake of 3 or more tris is more efficient than F3DEX2 and older microcodes. The efficiency gain is up to 4x (2 tris -&gt; 8 tris per 8-byte macro), though in typical meshes the gain is expected to be 2-3x.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md51"></a>
Vertex Cache Locality</h2>
<p>The key advantage of a triangle snake over a traditional triangle strip is that it better exploits the vertex cache.</p>
<p>In any microcode, the vertex cache is of a fixed size, and any continuous subset of it can be reloaded. Loading a vertex costs 16 bytes of memory throughput plus some RSP time to perform transformation and lighting. So, the goal of vertex cache optimization is to reduce the number of vertices reloaded (loaded a second time when they had been loaded in the past but are no longer loaded). A secondary goal is to reduce the number of vertices kept in the cache between loads, as doing so increases the average load size, which decreases the relative overhead of the loads.</p>
<p>It is optimal to load sets of vertices such that the <em>boundaries</em> of these sets&ndash;the set of vertices which are not unique to this set, which will therefore have to be reloaded or kept in the cache across a load&ndash;are as small as possible. Because meshes are usually approximately 2D surfaces curved in 3D, we want to maximize the ratio of area to circumference, which is a circle. In other words, optimal use of the vertex cache usually means loading round-ish regions of neighboring vertices.</p>
<p>Once such a region is selected, if it is to be rendered with triangle strips, they will quickly hit the edges of the region, and multiple strips will need to be used. Conversely, a triangle snake can "turn around" when it gets to the edge of the region, covering almost all tris in this region with a single command.</p>

    <p><em>If vertex loads are optimized for rendering with triangle strips, long "1D" sections of meshes will be loaded, which does not exploit the "2D" spatial locality of the vertex cache. This is especially inefficient if the export tool always reloads vertices instead of keeping them in the cache: in the case pictured, the entire top row of selected vertices will be immediately reloaded when rendering the next strip up.</em></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md52"></a>
What about yielding?</h2>
<p>Microcodes compatible with libultra&ndash;including the F3D family, S2DEX, JPEG decoder, etc.&ndash;are required to listen for a flag from the CPU, and if it is set, to save their state and stop executing. This allows the higher-priority audio microcode to be swapped in and run, which must occur soon after every VI. The audio microcode may take a few ms to run, so if it is delayed by more than a few ms, there is a risk of audio corruption.</p>
<p>Any command which results in RDP commands being enqueued&ndash;triangle or rectangle draws, texture loads, CC setting changes, etc.&ndash;can cause the current temporary RDP command buffer in DMEM to be flushed to the FIFO in RDRAM. If the latter is full, the command will wait until space is available. In an extreme case, the RDP may have to clear the framebuffer and depth buffer before making progress and opening up space in the FIFO, which can take several ms. Thus, the processing of most display list commands could theoretically cause the RSP to wait&ndash;delaying the yield&ndash;by several ms.</p>
<p>The triangle snake command, or any hypothetical command capable of drawing many triangles which cannot be interrupted by yields, can trigger a similar situation in a somewhat wider range of conditions. Suppose the following occurs:</p><ul>
<li>Earlier on in the frame, 100 large tris were enqueued, where each one will take 0.1 ms to draw on the RDP.</li>
<li>The RSP fills up the RDRAM FIFO while the RDP is getting up to the 100 large tris.</li>
<li>The RSP begins a 100-triangle long snake, with the FIFO full, right as the RDP begins rendering the 100 large tris.</li>
<li>Immediately after the snake starts, the CPU requests that the RSP yield.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since each pair of tris drawn in the snake require a buffer flush, and the tris the RSP is enqueuing are the same data size as the tris the RDP is rendering, the RSP will have to wait after each pair of tris in the snake for capacity in the RDP buffer before it can continue with the snake. In other words, the snake speed is limited by the RDP drawing speed for tris much earlier in the frame. In this example, the RSP will not finish the snake and respond to the yield for 10 ms, delaying the audio microcode too long and causing audio corruption.</p>
<p>This is still an unlikely case though:</p><ul>
<li>If your game has 100 consecutive tris which take a total of 10 ms of RDP time, this is probably poorly optimized to begin with.</li>
<li>When the FIFO fills up, this means wasted RSP time, even if this happens not to conflict with a yield. If the FIFO fills up often and RSP peformance is imporant in your game (either for audio or because the graphics are RSP bound), you should expand the FIFO.</li>
<li>A snake this long is rare in typical low-poly N64 meshes. And, the export tool could limit the maximum snake length generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>A future version of F3DEX3 could allow the snake command to yield in the middle. This has not been implemented yet because it is very difficult to validate. Yields are rare relative to display list commands (typically 1-2 of the former and many thousands of the latter per frame). And, until we have a robust F3DEX3 mesh optimizer and a game where most things are drawn with snakes (i.e. few vanilla assets left), snakes will also be rare in the display list. So it will be hard to know whether the yield-during-snake codepath is even being run, let alone whether it is correct in all cases.</p>

Comparison with Tiny3D</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HailToDodongo/tiny3d">Tiny3D</a>, the homebrew microcode, uses triangle strips as its accelerated triangles command. F3DEX3 triangle snakes have several advantages compared to Tiny3D's triangle strips:</p><ul>
<li>Tiny3D uses 16-bit indices (raw DMEM addresses) in triangle strips, which saves a multiply-add / table lookup for each index, but doubles the required memory bandwidth compared to 8-bit indices in the F3D family (including F3DEX3).</li>
<li>Any triangle strip is a special case of a triangle snake. So if triangle strips happen to be the most efficient way of rendering a particular mesh, F3DEX3 can directly use the same approach.</li>
<li>Triangle snakes better exploit the 2D spatial locality of the vertex cache than triangle strips, as discussed above. This leads to both fewer commands and fewer vertex loads.</li>
<li>There is no limit to the length of a triangle snake, because it uses the input buffer and its data is loaded as needed like other commands. This also means it does not share resources with anything else. In contrast, each Tiny3D triangle strip occupies slots in the vertex cache and is loaded all at once, so it is limited in length. The mesh format uses a clever approach where space becomes available in the vertex cache as tris are drawn, allowing increasingly long triangle strips. And, Tiny3D's vertex cache holds 70 vertices, up from 56 in F3DEX3, so Tiny3D could dedicate plenty of space to tri strips and still have the same vertex cache size as F3DEX3. Still, in the best case, F3DEX3 can load the whole vertex cache and then draw a single snake that uses all the vertices, while Tiny3D will draw a few separated tris and then a couple tri strips.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one advantage of the Tiny3D approach: similar to how F3DEX3 encodes a direction flag with each index for the snake, Tiny3D encodes a restart marker, which signals the start of a new strip without wasting any indices. Conversely, in F3DEX3, if a triangle snake ends early in the <code>SPContinueSnake</code> macro, the remaining bytes in that macro are wasted&ndash;the next snake cannot start until the next 8 byte aligned command. However:</p><ul>
<li>If 6, 7, or 8 indices are occupied in the macro, this is already at least as efficient as "wasting" up to two indices when starting a new strip/snake. And, if only 1 or 2 indices are occupied in the macro, there is no advantage to drawing those tris in the same snake as opposed to as separate tris. So it is only the 3, 4, and 5 indices cases where this constraint introduces inefficiency.</li>
<li>This can be mitigated during mesh export, to favor snakes whose lengths more closely match the 8 byte boundaries.</li>
<li>The memory bandwidth penalty of wasting these couple of bytes after each snake is much lower than the memory bandwidth penalty of having all the indices be 16-bit in Tiny3D. </li>
</ul>
